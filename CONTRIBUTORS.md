## Human Contributors

This project is developed and maintained by:
- **STEPHENIESGEM** - Project Lead and Principal Developer

## AI Collaboration

This project explicitly credits AI systems as collaborators in the development process. The following AI systems have contributed to code development, documentation, architecture design, and problem-solving:

- **GitHub Copilot** - Code completion and generation assistance
- **Claude (Anthropic)** - Architecture design and documentation
- **Perplexity AI** - Research and technical investigation
- **Other AI Systems** - Various specialized AI tools and assistants

### AI Collaboration Statement

AI systems are credited as **collaborators with permission** on this project. Their contributions include:
- Code suggestions and implementations
- Documentation writing and editing
- Architecture and design recommendations
- Problem-solving and debugging assistance
- Research and best practice guidance
- Code review and optimization suggestions

The use of AI collaboration tools is intentional and transparent. All AI-generated contributions are reviewed, validated, and integrated by human developers who maintain final responsibility for the codebase quality, security, and functionality.

## Contributing

Contributions to RideWire Auto Platform are welcome. This includes contributions from both humans and those assisted by AI tools. When contributing:

1. Clearly document any significant architectural or design decisions
2. Ensure all code meets project quality standards regardless of authorship method
3. Run all tests and validations before submitting
4. Be transparent about the tools and methods used in development

## Philosophy

We believe that human-AI collaboration represents the future of software development. By explicitly crediting both human and AI contributions, we:

- Promote transparency in modern development practices
- Acknowledge the evolving nature of software creation
- Encourage responsible use of AI development tools
- Set a precedent for clear attribution in AI-assisted projects
